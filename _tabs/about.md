I’ve been a software developer for over 5 years, but recently, I’ve found myself drawn deep into offensive security and malware development. I’ve always loved tricking systems and figuring out how they tick, so diving into this space just felt right.

Offensive security isn’t about sitting back and building defenses—it's about understanding the weaknesses others might exploit. Whether it’s studying vulnerabilities, testing out exploits, or dissecting malware, it’s all about learning how to break things (in the name of making them stronger, of course).

I’m not an expert yet, but I’m not a total newbie either. I’m here to share what I pick up along the way, from interesting tools to ways of thinking about security that go beyond just writing code. If you're into exploring how systems can be pushed to their limits, you’re in the right place. Let’s keep learning, hacking, and breaking things together.
