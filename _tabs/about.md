Hi, Welcome to my blog!

I'm interested in penetration testing, red teaming and malware development. 

I am only learning new things, and publishing them as I go, **I am not an expert** nor am I pretending to be one.

Hopefully you can learn something from my blog, and I can learn by teaching you, which is the better way of learning.

Happy hacking!
